### Dispatch stream of events to tables by event type

This is a fun but practical example that reads GitHub events from **dlt** repository (such as issue or pull request created, comment added etc.).
Each event type is sent to a different table in `duckdb`.

```py
import dlt
from dlt.sources.helpers import requests

@dlt.resource(primary_key="id", table_name=lambda i: i["type"], write_disposition="append")
def repo_events(
    last_created_at = dlt.sources.incremental("created_at")
):
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/dlt-hub/dlt/events?per_page=100"

    while True:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        yield response.json()

        # stop requesting pages if the last element was already older than initial value
        # note: incremental will skip those items anyway, we just do not want to use the api limits
        if last_created_at.start_out_of_range:
            break

        # get next page
        if "next" not in response.links:
            break
        url = response.links["next"]["url"]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='github_events',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='github_events_data',
)
load_info = pipeline.run(repo_events)
row_counts = pipeline.last_trace.last_normalize_info

print(row_counts)
print("------")
print(load_info)
```

Events content never changes so we can use `append` write disposition and track new events using `created_at` field.

We name the tables using a function that receives an event data and returns table name: `table_name=lambda i: i["type"]`

Now run the script:

```shell
python github_events_dispatch.py
```

Peek at created tables:

```shell
dlt pipeline -v github_events info
dlt pipeline github_events trace
```

And preview the data:

```shell
dlt pipeline -v github_events show
```

:::tip
Some of the events produce tables with really many child tables. You can [control the level of table nesting](general-usage/source.md#reduce-the-nesting-level-of-generated-tables) with a decorator.
