Welcome to the tutorial on how to efficiently use dlt to build a data pipeline. This tutorial will introduce you to the foundational concepts of dlt and guide you through basic and advanced usage scenarios.

As a practical example, we'll build a data pipeline that loads data from the GitHub API into DuckDB.

## What We'll Cover

- Fetching data seamlessly from the GitHub API.
- Understanding and managing data loading behaviors.
- Incrementally loading new data and deduplicating existing data.
- Making our data fetch more dynamic and reducing code redundancy.
- Securely handling secrets.
